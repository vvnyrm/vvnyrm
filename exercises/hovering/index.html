          fucked up and done.

        I wish I could lie
        <br>
        And never could fail
        <br>
      </p>
  And live some beautiful days
  In a magical place
  Beautiful loves
  Perfect and straight
  Beautiful days
  In a magical place
  A new dream is born
  The new freaks have come
  I wish I was fast
  And crazy as a dog
  I wish I could last
  As long as the gods
  I wish I could be
  Perfectly free
  Wish I was a creep
  Wish I made you bleed
  And live some beautiful days
  In a magical place
  Beautiful loves
  Perfect and straight
  Beautiful days
  In a magical place
  A new dream is born
  The new freaks have come
  Beautiful days
  In a magical place
  Beautiful loves
  Perfect and straight
  Beautiful days?
