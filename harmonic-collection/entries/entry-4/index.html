    What do I do when you can't hear? <br>
    What do I do when you not here? <br>
    Everything seems to disappear, <br>
    Now it's gone into the thin air. <br>

    Dad can you maybe hear me? <br>
    I've been calling your name now. <br>
    They said you were up in the clouds, <br>
    But I need you now, can you come down? <br>

    I done made some friends, <br>
    And I done made me some enemies. <br>
    No, I know this ain't the end of me, <br>
    Without you there is no energy. <br>

    I don't know where moms is, <br>
    Really wish you would come home. <br>

    Last girl broke my damn heart, <br>
    And then she broke it right through these damn bones. <br>

    See dad, I'm just growing up, <br>
    I wish you was here to show me stuff. <br>
    'Cause I know that it's not enough; <br>
    You taught me hate and then you showed me love. <br>

    Right now I don't got the trust. <br>
    Right now I don't got the love. <br>
    And suicide always in my mind <br>
    when I sit here and think I'm not enough. <br>

    I feel so much of that passion, <br>
    And lines is full of that strain. <br>
    But when I just rap to these broken kids, <br>
    and sits and get with the pain, man. <br>

    Man, these kids even they sing, <br>
    and they don't know what they did for me. <br>
    They give me confidence, <br>
    and they help me out with the inner me, goddamn. <br>
