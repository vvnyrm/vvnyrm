    Pretty much a two-man-team, Billie and her older brother, Finneas O'Conell, <br>
    has been recording and producing their music in Finneas' bedroom at their family home. <br>
    That is where the dream AND reality started. <br>
    Billie's music is iconic. It is within her voice and the way she portrays herself <br>
    in her music. The heavily effected vocals, harmonies, and sound effects such as <br>
    an Easy-Bake oven, dentist drill, and audience reastion, are all present in her songs. <br>

    If you have not already, give her music a try and you will be garenteed a journey. <br>
    A journey through emotions, actions, and exquisite techniques. <br>
